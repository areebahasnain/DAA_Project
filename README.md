Abstract
This paper presents the implementation and evaluation of two fundamental divide-and-conquer algorithms: the closest pair of points problem and Karatsuba's integer multiplication method. A comprehensive system was developed incorporating algorithm implementation, dataset generation, and an interactive user interface for visualization. Twenty test datasets of varying complexity were generated, with input sizes exceeding 100 elements for each algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate the correctness and efficiency of both implementations, with observed time complexities matching theoretical bounds of O(n log n) for closest pair and O(n^1.585) for Karatsuba multiplication. The system successfully provides an intuitive interface for users to select input files and visualize algorithm execution, making these complex divide-and-conquer strategies accessible for educational and practical purposes.
